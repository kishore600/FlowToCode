What is Flow-to-Code Generator? It's a developer tool that converts visual flowcharts into production-ready code. Think of it as a bridge between visual design and actual implementation, helping developers quickly turn their API designs and service architectures into working code.
Core Features:
1.	Convert flowcharts to working code (Express.js, Node.js, etc.)
2.	Generate API endpoints, services, and middleware
3.	Custom template system for different frameworks
4.	Built-in testing and documentation generation
Flow-to-Code Overview
How It Works:
1.	Input: Create a flowchart defining your API/service structure
2.	Processing: The system processes the flowchart through templates
3.	Output: Generates production-ready code, tests, and documentation
Use Cases:
•	Rapid API development
•	Microservices creation
•	Database operations
•	Event processing pipelines
Who Is It For?
•	Backend developers needing quick API setup
•	Teams wanting consistent code patterns
•	Startups requiring rapid prototyping
•	Enterprises standardizing services
Key Benefits:
1.	Speed: Reduce development time by automating boilerplate
2.	Consistency: Maintain standard patterns across projects
3.	Quality: Built-in best practices and testing
4.	Flexibility: Customizable templates for different needs
